# Summary

## Introduction Algorithm

Algorithm is a well-defined computation procedure that take some value as the input and then generate some value as the output. The example of algorithm are to check prime number, sorting, searching, etc.

## Algorithm's Characteristic

The characteristic of algorithm are:

- Have limitation (begin and end)
- Well-defined instructions
- Effective and efficient

Basic algorithm concept:

- Sequential
- Branching
- Looping

## Flowchart
