# Summary

## React Characteristics

- Declarative

  Declarative views make our code more predictable and easier to debug.

- Component-Based

  Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, we can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

- Learn Once, Write Anywhere

  We can render on the server using Node and also develop mobile application using React Native.

## Virtual DOM

DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern interactive web. To manipulate DOM in React, it requires Virtual DOM. Virtual DOM is a representation of the User Interface in the form of JavaScript Object that are stored in memory.
