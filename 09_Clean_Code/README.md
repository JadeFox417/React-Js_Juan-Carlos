# Summary

## Introduction to Clean Code

Clean code is the code that easy to read, easy to understand, and also easy to modify by a programmner. The reason why we need to do the clean code on the project are:

- Work Collaboration

  By keeping our code clean, other members of our project will easily understand about our code and give the review on it.

- Feature Development

  Clean code will make the development of the feature smoothly because each of the team member already understands the code of the feature to be developed.

- Faster Development

  If the feature develop smoothly, project development will be faster because we use clean code in our project.

## Clean Code Characteristics

1. Easy to understand
2. Easy to spell and find
3. Short but decribe the context
4. Consistent
5. Avoid adding the unused context
6. Give the comment (//) just for necessary content
7. Use good function
8. Use convention
9. Have good formatting

## Principle of Clean Code

1. KISS (Keep It So Simple)

   Avoid creating a function that used for do A, modify B, check function C; all at the same time.

2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

   Create reusable functions to avoid code duplication besides of create new function that have same method in it.

## Refactoring

Refactoring is a process of restructuring code by changing the internal structure without modifying the external. KISS's and DRY's Principle can be reach by refactoring the code.
