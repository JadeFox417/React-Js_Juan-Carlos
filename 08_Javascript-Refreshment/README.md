# Summary

## Introduction to JavaScript

Javascript is a high-level, scripting, untyped, and interpreted programming language. Javascript is one of the programming language that is easy to learn and understand by humans compared to Python, C++, and C.

## JavaScript Variable

In javascript, we don't need to declare the variable's datatype like in C/C++. There are 3 ways to declare a variable in JavaScript:

| Declaration    | var            | let                | const              |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Application    | rarely used    | not-fixed variable | fixed variable     |
| Hoisted\*      | allowed        | not allowed        | not allowed        |
| Value          | can be changed | can be changed     | can not be changed |
| Initialize     | can be emptied | can be emptied     | must contain value |
| Redeclaration  | allowed        | not allowed        | not allowed        |
| Reassignment   | allowed        | allowed            | not allowed        |
| Global Scope   | allowed        | allowed            | allowed            |
| Function Scope | not allowed    | not allowed        | not allowed        |
| Block Scope    | allowed        | not allowed        | not allowed        |

Note :

\*) hoisted = can use the variable before declaring the variable

## JavaScript Method

Method is a function that related to object and make the program as simple as possible that according to its use. There are some of method in JavaScript, like:

| Method  | Function                                                                          |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concat  | combine two or more array and return its value                                    |
| Map     | create new array with the result are calling a function for each array's elements |
| Foreach | calling a function for each arrays's elements                                     |
| Slice   | choose part of the array and return it                                            |
| Filter  | create new array by filetering each element new                                   |
| Reduce  | do operation on each array's elements to be single value from left to right       |
| etc     | ...                                                                               |

## JavaScript Control Flow

Control flow used for manage the execution flow on the program statement according to the case. There are 2 ways to control flow in JavaScript:

| Control Flow                       | Application                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repetition ( Looping / Iteration ) | for, while, do while                                              |
| Conditioning ( Branching )         | if ... else, switch, block, try ... catch, break, continue, throw |
