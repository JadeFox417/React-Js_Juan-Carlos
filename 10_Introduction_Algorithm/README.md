# Summary

## Introduction Algorithm

Algorithm is a well-defined computation procedure that take some value as the input and then generate some value as the output. The example of algorithm are to check prime number, sorting, searching, etc.

## Algorithm's Characteristic

The characteristic of algorithm are:

- Have limitation (begin and end)
- Well-defined instructions
- Effective and efficient

Basic algorithm concept:

- Sequential
- Branching
- Looping

## Flowchart

Flowchart is a chart with specific symbol that represent the sequence and relation between processes in detailed.

# Introduction Algorithm Practice

## 1. Is Prime Number

Given a number, the program needs to determine is the number prime or not.

</p>

## 2. Light and Button

There are N buttons from 1 to N and a light with off state. If button-i pressed, the light's state will changes (from off => on || from on => off) if N is divisible by i. If each button is pressed exactly once, what will the light's state be in the end?
